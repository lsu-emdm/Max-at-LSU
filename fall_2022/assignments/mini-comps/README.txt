Statement about the mini-composition (200-300 words):  Beat 2.0 begins with a sound sample taken from freesound.org. The original sample contained a couple of slow and spread out bleeps and bloops, which were then sped up and looped using the groove~ object. The sample was then layered on top of each other a number of times, with each separate instance of the sample being manipulated even further in some way. The first automated a bandpass filter and a transposition nob which moved the pitch slightly above and below the original, creating a floating middle texture. The automation was achieved using a cycle~ object with a very low frequency and the snapshot object, that recorded and scaled values to both the transposition nob and filter cutoff frequency ranges. The second comes in about halfway through the composition, and is transposed down 10,000 cents and run through a low-shelf filter and reversed, creating a low "bass" counterpoint to the original. The final instance is set a double the speed of the original sample, and is used to create rhythmic tension during the compositions final moments.
